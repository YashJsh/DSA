// Now let's solve like with time Complexity with  O(n)

// ðŸ’¡ Intuition Recap:
// We're not trying every pair
// We're asking:
// "What's the best number I could have seen before this one to subtract from it?"
// Thatâ€™s min_val
// If current number is bigger than min_val, it might give us a better answer!

// you can also understand with like best time to buy stocks, when the stock is lower price as compared to today's price
